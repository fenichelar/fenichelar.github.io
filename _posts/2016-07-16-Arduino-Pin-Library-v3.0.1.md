title: Arduino Pin Library Version 3.0.1
---

Version 3.0.1 of my Arduino Pin Library has been released! It contains the following improvements:

* Created class for Pin Group
* Improved toggle performance
* Added support for custom boards
* Improved documentation
* Improved examples

Why use this library?

* Much faster than built in digital functions
* More portable and easier to read than direct port manipulation
* Allows for simultaneous operations on multiple pins
* Supports custom boards

The source code can be found at [https://github.com/fenichelar/Pin](https://github.com/fenichelar/Pin). Complete documentation can be found at [https://pin.fenichelar.com](https://pin.fenichelar.com). The library is also avaliable on the Arduino Library Manager.
