I am a student at Georgia Institute of Technology in the Honors Program. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science concentrating in Intelligence and Devices. My passion is automation and robotics and I hope to use the skills I obtain from both degrees to turn science fiction into reality.
